    <description>
      Octopus Deploy is an automated deployment tool powered by NuGet. This tool adds a post-build activity to your Visual Studio project, so that an Octopus-compatible NuGet package is produced in the Bin directory whenever a Release build completes.

    <releaseNotes>This is an unofficial NuGet package of OctoPack from Octopus Deploy. This package was created to provide updates to OctoPack in a separate package because it seems that Octopus Deploy is no longer accepting pull request and has ceased making updates to the official package.

This package will follow the official updates and use the same version number using the revision number (4th digit) for additional enhancements. Any contributions from pull requests will also be reviewed and potentially accepted accordingly.

Contains the following enchancements:
- Added MSBuild property to specify the output directory for newly created packages `/p:OctoPackOutDir=C:\ExampleOutputDir\`</releaseNotes>
